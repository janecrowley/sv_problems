Prompt
Design a Full Adder (FA)—the most important building block for digital computation.

A FA is a fully combinational circuit that adds three single-bit inputs a, b, and cin (carry-in).  Inputs a and b are the two operands whereas cin represents the overflow bit carried forward from a previous addition stage.

The FA circuit has two single-bit outputs, sum and cout—the later represents the overflow bit to be used as a carry-in to a subsequent addition stage.

Input and Output Signals
a - First operand input bit
b - Second operand input bit
cin - Carry-in input bit from a previous adder stage
sum - Sum output bit
cout - Carry-out (overflow) output bit to be propagated to the next addition stage
