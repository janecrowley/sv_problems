Prompt
Thermometer (a.k.a. unary) coding is frequently used in digital systems applications to represent a natural number.  In a thermometer code, a N-bit binary number is represented by a (2 ** N)-bit digital word, which has m zeros followed by (N - m) ones or vice-versa.

Implement a thermometer code detector.  The module has two ports, codeIn and isThermemeter.  The former is a DATA_WIDTH-bit unsigned binary word, and the latter is the signal that indicates whether or not the input is a thermometer code.  The circuit must support both types of thermometer representations.  For instance, for an input word that is N-bit long, the detector must detect thermometer representations that use m zeros followed by (N - m) ones or m ones followed by (N - m) zeros.  Output isThermemeter is one when a thermometer word is detected at the input and zero otherwise.

Input and Output Signals
codeIn - Thermometer input word
isThermometer - Output bit that indicates whether or not an input word is a thermometer code

Example (Click to Expand)
The example below shows a sequence of 8-bit binary inputs.  Note that when codeIn = 8'b0000_0000 or codeIn = 8'b1111_1111, the output isThermometer becomes zero (i.e., not a thermometer).  When working with thermometer codes, select codeIn and change the radix from Hex to Bin in order to better visualize it in the waveform viewer.
